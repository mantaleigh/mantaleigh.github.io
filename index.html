                                <p>I like to think of myself as an adventurer. I was born in Southern California, raised in small-town Texas, and am now enjoying living on the East Coast as I attend Wellesley College for a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. But my adventures have never taken me far from technology: I've been playing around with computers since I was a baby and still haven't lost my fascination for all things tech. In fact, now most of my adventures involve new programming projects and opportunites, and I'm loving every minute!</p>    

            <p>When I'm not studying, I tutor for the Computer Science Department at Wellesley College and work on perfecting my latte art as a  Barista  at Starbucks. Even though the semester keeps me busy, I also find time to hike and snowboard, travel wherever I can manage, bake with my friends, eat a lot of Italian food, and work on personal projects.</p>

We built a (not pretty, but functional) minesweeper game and then programmed different hand motions used to play. Moving your right hand in a circle reveals what's behind a square and pushing your left index finger towards the screen uses a disarm kit on a mine, allowing you to safely uncover the square. We also included images of Drumpf as the mines for the lols.

This can be time consuming and imprecise. This web app allows students who are searching for colleges to find out exactly how the students are feeling at that school based on sentiment analysis of the campus' recent yaks and a wordcloud associated with those yaks. This was my second adventure in backend development, and my first exposure to Flask.</p>

                                        <p><i>Project with a team at Hack@Brown, Spring 2016.</i><br><b>Winner - Beginner Hack</b><br>The beautiful result of 4 women deciding that it was time to have a little fun at a hackathon and push ourselves out of our comfort zones. This is actually one of my favorite projects I've ever worked on. It takes a selfie, analyzes that image for emotions, and uses those emotions to find a gif perfect for how you're feeling! This was my first foray into Django, Apache, setting up a Linux server, and any backend development at all. Until the hackathon code gets fixed please don't give it anything other than a selfie (it doesn't fail gracefully, yet).
